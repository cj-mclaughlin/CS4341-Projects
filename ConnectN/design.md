# Heuristic Design Planning

### Symmetric Heuristics
- Completing a game
- \# of items next to each other
- \# of potential oppurtunities (e.g how many possible lines each player has to win the game)


### Other ideas
- Exponential scoring (e.g. opponent winning next move warrants immediate response)
- Genetic algorithm with different heuristic weights
